This project was done in collaboration with [VicHenFel](https://github.com/VicHenFel). 

## Overview
This repo contains the Python code for our final project of ME441 Engineering Optimization for Product Design and Manufacturing at Northwestern. For our project, we chose to implement Sequential Quadratic Programming in Python. We validated our SQP implementation by testing on benchmark optimization functions and compared results against SQP implementations in standard optimization packages such as Scipy and Isight.

Code can be found here: [SequentialQP](https://github.com/larisaycl/SeqQP)

Some results from our SQP optimization, in comparison with results obtained using Scipy, are shown:
