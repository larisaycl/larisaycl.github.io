## Overview
<!-- This repo contains the Python code for the robot learning assignment of CS/ME 469 ML and AI for Robotics at Northwestern.  -->
This project was done for the robot learning assignment of CS/ME 469 ML and AI for Robotics at Northwestern. For this project, I chose to implement a GMM-GMR pipeline in python to learn a model for the inverse kinemaitcs of a differential drive robot. The datasets used for the project can be found [here](http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/datasets/mrclam/index.html). Code is not provided since this is a homework assignment.

Some results from the model trained using this implementation:
