## [GMM-GMR](https://github.com/larisaycl/gmmgmr-mlai21)
This repo contains the Python code for the robot learning assisngment of CS/ME 469 ML and AI for Robotics at Northwestern. For the project, I chose to implement a GMM-GMR pipeline in python to learn a model for the inverse kinemaitcs of a differential drive robot. The datasets used for the project can be found [here](http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/datasets/mrclam/index.html).
