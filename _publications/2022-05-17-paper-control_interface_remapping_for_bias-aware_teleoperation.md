Abstract
======
Users of assistive devices vary in their extent of
motor impairment, and hence their physical interaction with
control interfaces can differ. There is the potential for improved
utility if control interface actuation is mapped to assistive
device control signals in a manner customized to each user.
In this paper, we present (1) a method for creating a custom
interface to assistive device control mapping based on the design
of a user’s bias profile, (2) a procedure and virtual task for
gathering interface actuation data from which to build the
bias profile and map, and (3) an evaluation of our method
on 6 participants with upper limb motor impairments. Our
results show that custom interface remapping based on user
bias profiles shows promise in providing assistance via an
improvement in the reachability of the device control space.
This effect was especially pronounced for individuals who had
a more limited reachable space.
