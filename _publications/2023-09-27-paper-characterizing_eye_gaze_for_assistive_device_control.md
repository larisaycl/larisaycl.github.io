Abstract
======
Eye gaze tracking is increasingly popular due
to improved technology and availability. However, in assistive
device control, eye gaze tracking is often limited to discrete
control inputs. In this paper, we present a method for collecting
both reactionary and control eye gaze signals to build an indi-
vidualized characterization for eye gaze interface use. Results
from a study conducted with motor-impaired participants are
presented, offering insights into maximizing the potential of eye
gaze for assistive device control. These findings can inform the
development of continuous control paradigms using eye gaze.
